This web application is an award submission and management
website. There are three kinds of people -- Employees , Managers
and Administrators. All Employees can submit an award to another
employee, and managers control the permission. Administrators
can manage all the data in database.

I believe I finished all the requirement of the requirement file
according to my understanding.
